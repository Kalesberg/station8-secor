                  "biography": "As a dual citizen of the United States and Poland, Dariusz Cichocki understands the complexities of domestic and international energy markets.  In May 2020, he was jointly responsible for delivering the first shipment of U.S. crude oil to Belarus. In July, he arranged a deal to provide the country with a new blended oil variety, White Eagle Blend (WEB), developed by 3 Seas Energy.\n\nNow based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and operating from the heart of North America’s crude oil hub in Cushing, Mr. Cichocki leads 3 Seas Energy, a global operator in crude oil logistics, storage and transportation that provides solutions for emerging European and Asian energy markets. Additionally, he has extensive experience with U.S. and Canadian midstream assets through his role as president of Tulsa-based Getka. He founded Getka Energy in 2018  and relaunched Getka in 2020 to refocus on a global market, connecting U.S. energy supply with European energy demand.\n\nMr. Cichocki is fluent in five languages: English, Polish, Russian, Czech and Arabic. He previously worked with Enbridge Energy as lead strategist for commercial tank and pipeline operations in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions. He managed more than 20 million barrels of commercial oil storage and several pipeline systems, delivering more than 850,000 barrels of various crude types to market each day. His work led Enbridge to experience a 250 percent increase in revenue in its business units throughout the Midcontinent region.\n\nMr. Cichocki also has experience in crude by rail, focusing on market growth in North Dakota’s Bakken oil fields, national energy policy, biofuels, and technology development. He has managed oil and gas activities for private equity in several business sectors in Europe and the Middle East. He also worked with the Lama Energy Group to develop the Wildhorse project, a greenfield terminal project located in Cushing, Oklahoma.\n\nMr. Cichocki studied Arabic at the prestigious American University in Cairo and earned dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and Psychology/Social Relations from the University of New England. He also holds a Master of Science degree in Global Affairs with a focus on Energy Policy from New York University. He has lived in Europe and Northern Africa and enjoys traveling to other parts of the world, getting to know, and learning from, other cultures. He proudly calls Tulsa home and enjoys serving in an ambassadorial role to attract new businesses and talent to the city. His interests include spending time with his family, traveling, reading and working on cars.",
