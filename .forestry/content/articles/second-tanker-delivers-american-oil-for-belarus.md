MINSK, 9 August (BelTA) â€“ The second tanker ship carrying American oil for Belarus has arrived in the port of Klaipeda, BelTA learned from Aleksandr Tishchenko, Press Secretary of the Belarusian state petrochemical concern Belneftekhim, on 9 August.

The spokesman said that a tanker brought 76,000 tonnes of American oil of the White Eagle blend to the Klaipeda port. Unloading will begin in the evening.

In his words, oil will be transported by rail to the oil refinery in Novopolotsk. The first few tank cars will reach the oil refinery on 12-13 August and the processing of the entire batch will begin by the end of the month.

It is the second batch of American oil delivered for Belarus by a tanker ship. This oil blend was chosen as an analog replacement of the Russian blend Urals for European oil refineries.

BelTA reported earlier that the first tanker ship with American oil for Belarus left the port of Beaumont on 16 May. As much as 77,000 tonnes of the Bakken oil blend was delivered to Klaipeda on 5 June.
